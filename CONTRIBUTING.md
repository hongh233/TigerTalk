## Style Guidelines

### Follow the formatting guidelines
This means:
- Spaces around parentheses: `if (conditionA) { }`
- 4 spaces indentation
- `camelCase` for normal variables and methods, `SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- To be added

### Use ArrayList instead of LinkedList
Until now, we don't have too much lists to insert and delete elements. Therefore, arraylist is better for get elements.

### Align controller with axios calling
Once a controller method is created, make sure have a correspond Axios calling: `axios.post(URL)` added into the `./frontend/src/axios` folder
